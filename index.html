      <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
      <p>
        The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by
        Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the
        longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation,
        it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the
        "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly
        styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing
        model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck"
        proportions.[3]

      <h1>Dodge Challenger</h1>
      <p>
        The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of
        automobiles (two of those being pony cars) produced by American
        automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger
        name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the
        full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.

        The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size[1][2] American automobile
        manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car.[3][4][5][6] It
        first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and
        was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared
        its platform and major components with the Firebird, produced by General
        Motors' Pontiac division that was also introduced for 1967.
